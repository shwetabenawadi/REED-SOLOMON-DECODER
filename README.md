# REED-SOLOMON-DECODER
The VLSI design of the Reed–Solomon Decoder was simulated in Cadence to verify syndrome generation, error detection, and correction. The design was then implemented in OpenLane using the SKY130A PDK, completing synthesis to GDSII with 98% functional accuracy and 100% DRC/LVS-clean layout.
